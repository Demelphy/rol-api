## Take Your First Steps

### Understand the basics

Not sure what a pull request is, or how to submit one? Take a look at GitHub's excellent [help documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) first.

### Search JIRA; create an issue if necessary

Is there already an issue that addresses your concern? Do a bit of searching in our [JIRA issue tracker](https://eversky.atlassian.net/) to see if you can find something similar. If you do not find something similar, please create a new JIRA issue before submitting a pull request unless the change is truly trivial -- for example: typo fixes, removing compiler warnings, etc.

## Create a Branch

### Branch from master

Master currently represents work toward next version. Please submit all pull requests there, even bug fixes and minor improvements.

### Use short branch names

Branches used when submitting pull requests should preferably be named according to JIRA issues, e.g. 'ROL-1234'. Otherwise, use succinct, lower-case, dash (-) delimited names, such as 'fix-warnings', 'fix-typo', etc. In [fork-and-edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button) cases, the GitHub default 'patch-1' is fine as well. This is important, because branch names show up in the merge commits that result from accepting pull requests and should be as expressive and concise as possible.
